## Predicting COVID-19 Mortality Rates using Machine Learning Models
This study focuses on predicting COVID-19 mortality rates using machine learning models. During the COVID-19 pandemic, which lasted from 2020 to 2023, high-risk groups faced severe illness and higher mortality rates. With medical supply shortages, prioritizing patients for treatment became critical. The study uses a dataset from Kaggle to build and evaluate three machine learning models: logistic regression, random forest, and neural network. The neural network model demonstrated the highest performance with an AUC score of 0.96 and a test accuracy of 91.03%. This model's accuracy can help healthcare providers prioritize care and allocate resources effectively, providing a foundation for future research in predictive healthcare.
